# CMP301 - Graphics Programming with Shaders - Final project

## Module CMP301 - Graphics Programming with Shaders Description
Abertay University - 3rd year module

### Module Aim
Learn skills and techniques graphics programmable pipeline, shaders, vertex manipulation, post processing, tessellation, geometry generation on GPU, per pixel lighting including shadows etc

### Module Topics
1. Intro to Programmable Pipeline (Direct3D/X 11 and Shaders)
2. Sending data to GPU. Textures and Transforms
   1. Geometry and non-geometry data
   2. Registers
   3. C++ and HLSL
   4. Sampler
   5. Types of textures, texture format, shader and loading.
3. Lighting
   1. Lighting Recap (Directional, point and spotlight, ambient, diffuse and specular light; Per vertex ligthing and per pixel)
      & Vector Dot and Cross Product recap.
   3. Sending lighting data to the GPU
   4. Calculating lighting on the GPU
   5. Point Lights
4. Lighting 2
   1. Specular (Phong, Blinn-Phong, Gaussian distribution & Beckman distribution methods)
   2. Attenuation
   3. Multiple Lights
   4. Physical base rendering (PBR)
   5. Normal Mapping
5. Vertex Manipulation (Vertex Shader)
   1. Displacement Maps
   2. Deforming Surfaces - Creating dynamic surfaces
   3. Mesh Morphing
   4. Mesh Skinning - Animating Meshes
   5. Normal Recalculation
6. Render to Texture & Orthographic Projections
   1. Shadow Mapping
   2. Post Processing (Blur, Ambient Occlusion...)
   3. Dynamic reflection
   4. Game Mechanics - Portal, in-game camera's
   5. Deferred Rendering
   6. Multi-pass rendering
7. Post Processing using Render to Texture
   1. Post processing
   2. Multi pass rendering
   3. Blur (Box blur & Gaussian Blur)
   4. Other Post Processing effects.
      1. Camera effected: Motion blur, Glow, Bloom, Bokeh (Shallow depth of flied), Lens flare/distorsion...
      2. Colour filtering
      3. Chromatic aberration
8. Tessellation
   1. Hull Shader
   2. Tessellator
   3. Domain Shader
9. Depth Buffer and Shadow Maps
10. Geometry Shader
11. Compute Shader
       
### Assessment
1. Weekly submitions as part of the lab work for each topic
2. Final Project at the end of the semester (own construction)

## Project Description
Graphics programming with shaders final project. Includes the topics: Colour Shaders, Texturing, Lighting, Vertex Manipulation, Render to texture, post processing, tessellation, shadow maps and geometry shader.

WARNING - Project may need re-targeted to compile. Check the version of the Windows SDK.
